# Print "Hello world"

Example pseudocode:

```
string1 = "Hello "
string2 = "world"

print(string1 + string2)
```

Use the most idiomatic way of concatenating strings for the language,
and try doing the same thing with various internal functions, like `[string1, string2].join(' ')`

Example input:

n/a

Expected output:

```
Hello world
```
